# Quantum Computing

## **Summarizing 量子コンピュ-タが人工知能を加速する written by Hidetoshi Nishimori** 

First, there was the creation of D-wave.

D-wave, unlike other Quantum Computers, used Quantum Annealing instead of Quantum Gates or Quantum (electrical) circuits. 



### What is Quantum Computing?

Quantum Computers solve problems faster than contemporary computers , about up to one hundred million times. This is only the case for  particular type of problems, in other words, it cannot be used universally. Quantum Computers are adept at solving Combinatorial Optimazation Problems. 

#### What is <u>Optimazation Problem</u>?

TSP is a type of Combinatorial Optimazation Problem. 

The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a widely studied combinatorial optimization problem, which, given a set of cities and a cost to travel from one city to another, seeks to identify the tour that will allow a salesman to visit each city only once, starting and ending in the same city, at the minimum cost.

There are two ways to find the answer to this problem, which is first, finding the most accurate, strict answer and second, finding the approximate value.

When using Quantum Computation, you can find the most accurate answer, or, the chances of finding the at least the most closest approximate value goes up. 

### Application of Quantum Computers

Quantum Computers give answers to Optimization Problems, they also help analyzing molecules, and they can even be used in the area of Artificial Intelligence.

### What is D-wave?

D-wave is a venture company created by Geordie Rose. At that time, Quantum Computers mainly used Quantum Gate operations, but they were too unstable, and the number of qubits was so litter. At 2007, D-wave used 16 qubits, 2011 128qubits, and finally 2015 more than 1000qubits were used.
