First, there was the creation of D-wave.

D-wave, unlike other Quantum Computers, used Quantum Annealing instead of Quantum Gates or Quantum (electrical) circuits. 



### What is Quantum Computing?

Quantum Computers solve problems faster than contemporary computers , about up to one hundred million times. This is only the case for  particular type of problems, in other words, it cannot be used universally. Quantum Computers are adept at solving Combinatorial Optimazation Problems. 

#### What is <u>Optimazation Problem</u>?

TSP is a type of Combinatorial Optimazation Problem. 



### Quantum Algorithms : Deutsch's algorithm






### Quantum Algorithms : Grover's search algorithm
